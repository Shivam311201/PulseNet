# PulseNet

PulseNet is a cloud-native microservices platform that collects telemetry from multiple IoT devices, including health bands and mobile devices, and delivers automated daily summary emails to users. It efficiently handles high-frequency health data and periodic device usage while ensuring scalability and fault-tolerance.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Health Data**: Devices push telemetry (heart rate, steps, sleep) to Kafka for low-latency processing.
- **Periodic Device Usage**: Mobile devices send usage stats every 10â€“15 mins via REST or Kafka.
- **Daily Summaries**: Aggregates health and device usage metrics per user and sends automated summary emails.
- **Scalable & Resilient**: Kafka for ingestion, Kubernetes for orchestration, Docker for containerization.
- **Cloud-Native Infrastructure**: Deployed on AWS EC2 / EKS, managed via Terraform and ArgoCD.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for observability.

## Tech Stack

- Spring Boot
- Kafka
- MySQL
- Docker
